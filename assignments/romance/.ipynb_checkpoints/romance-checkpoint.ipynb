    "The original file was way too large for my computer to handle. I could not work on it not only on my own laptop with jupyter running locally, but also it didn't work on online platforms like google collab as well. My computer ran out of memory all the time. I managed to take a look at the data, and saw that the majority of the data was missing. There were 51,000 rows where all the values were NaN. I could not drop these rows in jupyter while working because my computer could not handle anything after calling read_csv(), so I wrote a simple python program to drop all these rows and save the rest as 'romance_small.csv', so I am reading that file here. I will be sending my python program as well as this notebook.s"
